"""Cross-PR overlap detection — flag other open PRs stepping on this one.

While reviewing a PR, Mira compares it against the repo's other open PRs and
surfaces the ones that either touch the same code (merge-conflict risk) or
pursue the same goal (duplicate effort). The pipeline is:

    list open PRs → build/lookup fingerprints → cheap pre-filter → LLM judgment

The deterministic pre-filter (file/symbol intersection + title similarity) runs
first so only genuinely-overlapping candidates reach the single batched LLM
call. Everything here is best-effort: any failure returns no findings rather
than blocking the review.
